# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**
Joey and Emily will review videos and do 'reading rainbows' together each day.
We will also be utilizing LiveShare regularly to help one another work through the code together as a team.

### Conflict Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**
One person will summon the power of the dark lord, at which time the weakest link will be banished, condemned to work on buggy code that will never run properly and forced to listen to new country music.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**
We will talk candidly to each other about the situation if one of us is feeling that the other is taking over

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
We are committed to being patient and helping each other to gain an understanding of the material to the best of our abilities
